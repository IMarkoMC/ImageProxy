# ImageProxy
A simple NodeJS proxy for images

This is a really old project so expect it to have bugs/glitches and some updates/recodes on the near future


## Calls/URLS

### [GET] localhost:2500/get/(server)/(id)
 #### Example: localhost:2500/get/imgur/1234532
>  That will download or read the saved image and send it to the client, you can use whatever service you want, the imgur link is just to show an example
